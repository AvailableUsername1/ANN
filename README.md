# Numpy implementation of an artificial neural network

The motivation for this project stems from the desire to get a deeper understanding of how neural networks work. I finished the deep learning specialization on coursera including the programming exercises but I still felt like my grasp on material was weak.

I was fortunate enough to stumble on Michael Nielsen's book "Neural networks and Deep learning". It provided very good intuition on how neural networks work and provided code for implementing one. After studying the first two chapters of the book I decided to try to implement one myself. And here is the result! A neural network that learns. After so many bugs seeing the accuracy on validation set going up after each epoch was unbelievable.

My recommendation for every newbie in deep learning is to try to do the same. Good luck on your deep learning quest!

PS. My best result can be seen in the jupyter notebook.
